Project: P003.Abstraction

	Principal
		
		A folder Principal is created
		
		All classes use namespace P003.Abstraction
		
		Shape: create an abstract class with two methods 		
			abstract class Shape 
			
			methods: 
				public abstract void Draw();
				public void SayHi()
			
		Program.cs
			Go to program.cs and try to create an object to Shape and you'll get an error. 
			Cannot create an object for abstract class 
			Abstract class is always a base class

		Line: create a new class line and it will inherit from Shape
			Line will need to implement the Draw method as well 
				public override void Draw()
				
		Program.cs 
			var line = new Line();
			line.SayHi();
			line.Draw();
			
		Run Result 
			Hi from the abstract class
			Hi from the draw method in line class
