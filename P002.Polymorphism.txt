Project: P002.Polymorphism

	Principal
		
		A folder Principal is created
		
		All classes use namespace P002.Polymorphism
		
		Attempt #1
		
			Shape: is the base class and has a single Method Draw		
				public void Draw()
			Circle: inherits from Shape and has the same method as parent called Draw
				public void Draw()
			Line: inherits from Shape and has the same method as parent called Draw
				public void Draw()
			Triangle: inherits from Shape and has the same method as parent called Draw
				public void Draw()
			
			The draw method in Circle, Line and Triangle is hidden
			
			Program.cs 
				Shape[] shapes = new Shape[4];
				shapes[0] = new Shape();
				shapes[1] = new Circle();
				shapes[2] = new Line();
				shapes[3] = new Triangle();
				
				foreach (var shape in shapes)
				{
					shape.Draw();
				}
				
			Run Results
				I am a simple shape
				I am a simple shape
				I am a simple shape
				I am a simple shape
				
		Attempt #2 
			Shape: add the virtual keyword with Draw method 
				public virtual void Draw()
				
			In Circle, Line and Triangle add override key word with the draw methods 
				public override void Draw()
				
			Run Results 
				I am a simple shape
				I am a simple circle
				I am a simple line
				I am a simple triangle
