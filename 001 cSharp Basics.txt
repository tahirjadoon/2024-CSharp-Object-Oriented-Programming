Operators
	?. and ?[] Null-conditional operators oe safe navigation operator
		if a evaluates to null, the result of a?.x or a?[x] is null.
		The null-conditional operators are short-circuiting. That is, if one operation in a chain of conditional member or element access operations returns null, the rest of the chain doesn't execute.
		In the following example, B isn't evaluated if A evaluates to null and C isn't evaluated if A or B evaluates to null:
		A?.B?.Do(C);
		
		
		double SumNumbers(List<double[]> setsOfNumbers, int indexOfSetToSum)
		{
			return setsOfNumbers?[indexOfSetToSum]?.Sum() ?? double.NaN;
		}
		Example 1
			var sum1 = SumNumbers(null, 0);
			Console.WriteLine(sum1);  // output: NaN
			
		Example 2
			List<double[]?> numberSets =
			[
				[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
				null
			];

			var sum2 = SumNumbers(numberSets, 0);
			Console.WriteLine(sum2);  // output: 6

			var sum3 = SumNumbers(numberSets, 1);
			Console.WriteLine(sum3);  // output: NaN
	
	?? null-coalescing operator : returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't null ; otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result
		int? a = null;
		Console.WriteLine((a ?? 3)); // expected: 3 since a is still null 
		
	??= null-coalescing assignment operator : assigns the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to null
		List<int>? numbers = null;
		int? a = null;
		(numbers ??= new List<int>()).Add(5);
		numbers.Add(a ??= 0); //if a is null then assign 0 to a and add a to the list
	
	?: ternary conditional operator : evaluates a Boolean expression and returns the result of one of the two expressions
		condition ? consequent : alternative
		
	! null-forgiving, or null-suppression, operator
		public class Person
		{
			public Person(string name) => Name = name ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(name));
			public string Name { get; }
		}
		
		var person = new Person(null!);
		Without ! will get Warning CS8625: Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type
		
	:: namespace alias qualifier : to access a member of an aliased namespace

Object Oriented Programming 
	Inheritance: The process of creating the new class by extending the existing class or the process of inheriting the features  of base class 

	Encapsulation: Encapculation is the process of binding data members (vraiables, properties) and methods together

	Polymorphism: Poly means many and Morph means forms. It is the process in which an object or function take different forms

	Abstraction: is the process of showing only essential features of an object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information.
	
	Methods: 
		Code block
		Can pass params by value - using a copy
		Can pass by reference: using the variale itself - ref or out keyword 
		
	Overloaded Methed: Multiple methods with the same name but different arguments 

	Sealed Classes: no one can inherit from these 
	
	Static Classes: Cannot create instance, are sealed and have static members
	
	Nested Classes: A class placed inside a class 
	
	Partial Classes: Can create classes into different files with keyword partial 
	
	Access Modifiers
		Public: access is not restricted
		Protected: Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class
		Private: Access is limited to the containing type 
		Internal: Access is limited to the current assembly
		Proected internal: access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class
		
	Namespaces: is a container, used for grouping, organising code
	
	Struct: use the same access modifiers as classes 
		Classes are reference type where as struct are value type 
		Classes lives on heap, struct lives inline - stack
		Struct cannot support inheritance
		
	enum: an enum (or enumeration type) is used to assign constant names to a group of numeric integer values
		
	this: The this keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.
	
	Interfaces: 
		Interface has no implementation
		It only has the definition for a group of related functionalities
		Will need a class or struct to implement the interface
		It is a contract, classes or struct inplementing the interface should follow
		
	Interfaces VS Abstract 
		Similarities
			Can't be instantiated
			Must implement all its members
			Can contain events, methods and properties 
		Differences
			Interfaces 															Abstract Classes
				Can't have method implementation									Can have method implementations
				Allow multiple inheritance											Doesn't allow multiple inheritance 
				Can't have access modifiers, all public								Can contain access modifiers
				Can't contain variables												Can contain variables 
				
	Composition: can be defined as "part-of" relationship between objects
		Engine is part of car
		The life time of the child instance is dependent upon the parent / owner class 
		When the parent object is delete, the child object is destroyed as well 
			
			
	Aggregation: can be defined as "has-a" relationship between objects
		Teachers and addresses, a teacher must have an address associated 
		One owner
		
	Association: can be defined as "using" relationship between objects 
		A teacher can be teaching many students and student may be learning from many teachers
		There is no ownership
		No lifetime dependency
		
	Generic & Non Generic Collections
		Generic												Non Generic
		Type as a parameter
		Elements of only one type							Multiple type
		Type Safetly
		System.Collections.Generic							System.Collections
		
		Non Generic Collection
			ArrayList, Hashtable, SortedList, Stack, Queue, BitArray
			
			Stack: Stack works as last-in first-out (LIFO) collection
			Queue: Queue works as first-in first-out 
			
		Generic
			List<T> or IList<T>: generic collection that stores the elements of same type. Grows and shrinks. 
			SortedDictionary: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted on the key
			
	Tuples
		Can have 7 itms, 8th is nested tuple
		
	Delegates
		A delegate is a reference type
		Holds the reference to the method
		allow methods to be passed as parameters
		are type safe
		Delegate helps implement Encapsulation, Security, Callback (Obviously), Re-usability and if used wisely, Polymorphism also
			Simple 
				public delegate void PlayerInfoDelegate();
				public delegate void PlayerInfoWithNameDelegate(string playerName);
				PlayerInfoDelegate ronaldinho = new PlayerInfoDelegate(DisplayInformation);
				ronaldinho.Invoke();
				ronaldinho();
			Multicast
				public delegate void SayHiDelegate();
				SayHiDelegate sayHi = null;
				sayHi = new SayHiDelegate(SayHiEnglish);
				sayHi += new SayHiDelegate(SayHiSpanish);
				sayHi();
			Generic
				public delegate T DisplayInfoDelegate<T>(T value);
				DisplayInfoDelegate<int> myNumber = new DisplayInfoDelegate<int>(DisplayValue);
				Console.WriteLine(myNumber(100));
			Annonymous
				DisplayInfoDelegate normalDelegateAnonymous = delegate { Console.WriteLine("Hi from the anonymous method"); };
				normalDelegateAnonymous();
			Lambda
				delegate int MultiplyDelegate(int n);
				MultiplyDelegate multiplyNum = n => n * 3;
				Console.WriteLine(multiplyNum(30));
				
				delegate void DisplayMsgDelegate();
				DisplayMsgDelegate message = () => { Console.WriteLine("Hi from the anonymous method"); };
				message();
		Func 
			built in generic delegate
			it has upto 16 parameters 
			it has one out parameter
			the last parameter is considered as an out parameter
			must return a value
			
			Func<int, int, int> funcOne = AddTwoNumbers;
            Console.WriteLine("funcOne = " + funcOne(3, 10));
			
		Action
			Action delegate is the same as Func except it doesn't return a value 
			
			Action<int> action1 = DisplayInformation;
            action1(16);
			
		Predicate 
			is the same as Func and Action delegates. 
			It must take one input parameter
			returns a boolean value 
			
			Predicate<int> condition = IsAdmin;
            Console.WriteLine("Is emp 11 admin: " + condition(11));
			
		Annonymous and FUNC or Lambda exaple 
			//Annonymous Method
			Func<string, string> annonmyousMethod = delegate (string myName) { return myName.ToUpper(); };
			Console.WriteLine($"With AnnonmyousMethod changing '{text}' = " + annonmyousMethod(text));

			//Lambda Expression
			Func<string, string> lambdaExpression = intext => intext.ToUpper();
			Console.WriteLine($"With LambdaExpression changing '{text}' = " + lambdaExpression(text));
			
		Annonymous and Action or Lambda exaple 
			//Annonymous method
            Action<string> anonymousMethod = delegate (string inName) { Console.WriteLine($"Hi, how are you today '{inName}'? I am anonymousMethod"); };
            anonymousMethod(name);

            //lambda Expression
            Action<string> lambdaExpression = inName => { Console.WriteLine($"Hi, how are you today '{inName}'? I am lambda expression"); };
            lambdaExpression(name);
